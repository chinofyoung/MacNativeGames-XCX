# Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (work in progress)

An experiment: run Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition natively the way the original MacNativeGames project's
`games/by3` runs Bayonetta 3. It starts from that code (rewriter, loader, Horizon host, NVN on Metal) and keeps its own
copies of all of it in this folder (`runtime/`, `third_party/d2r`, `third_party/d2r_gfx`, `prebuilt/`, `tools/`,
`scripts/`); the other games are not part of this repository. **It reaches the title screen, character creation and
gameplay in Primordia** (stages 4 and 5, in progress): characters, text and the HUD are drawn, the first battle plays,
saves write and Continue loads them, a controller and the keyboard work, and the root `build_app.py` turns the
player's XCI into a self-contained, double-clickable app in one command (`make app` builds a development app).
Only those areas have been checked so far (on an M1 MacBook Air, at the game's 30 fps). The stage sections below say
how each step was reached; the user-facing summary is the repository's [README](../../README.md).

Players build with one command from the repository root, `python3 build_app.py <game.xci> -k <prod.keys>` (see the
[README](../../README.md#build-and-run)); it runs the steps below and this folder's Makefile targets, checks each one, and
packages a self-contained app. The steps below are the developer path. The shader translator in `prebuilt/` is built
from `tools/totk_xlate` and the repository's `vendor/ryujinx` (see `prebuilt/macos-arm64/README.md`).

How the work was done, what was found and what went wrong on the way: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

You must own the game: use your own XCI and the `prod.keys` dumped from your own Switch. Nothing from the game is in
this repository; the work folder and `mods/` are ignored by git. There is one work folder, `XCX_build/` at the
repository root: `build_app.py` (and its window) use it by default, and the commands below pass it as `WORK`.

## Inputs

Two versions are supported, side by side: update **1.0.1** (`v101`, Patch meta v65536) and **2.0.0** (`v200`,
v196608). The table is `scripts/app_bundle.py` `VERSIONS`; each version has its pins in
`assets/expected-<display>.json`, its folders in the work folder (`extracted/<v>`, `rewritten/<v>`,
`cache/verify_<v>`, `build/<v>/`, `build/xcx-native-<v>`, `build/launcher-<v>`, `build/data-bundles/GameData-<v>.bundle`)
and its compile-time define (`runtime/game_version.h`, `make VERSION=v200` passes `-DXCX_GAME_V200`). The version built
is the update's. 2.0.0 is cumulative over v0: its BKTR maps every byte to the base or its own data, never to 1.0.1.

- One XCI holding base `0100453019AA8000` (v0) and update 1.0.1 `0100453019AA8800` (v65536) with its common ticket.
  `title.keys` is not needed: the base Program NCA uses the key area and the update's title key comes from that ticket.
- Or the base from a base NSP (or a base-only XCI) and the update from its own NSP: `extract_code.py` and
  `merge_romfs.py` take `--update <update.nsp>`, and `--title-keys <title.keys>` for an NSP without a common ticket (a
  personalized ticket is then passed over). NSPs carry no system update, so the fonts come from `--firmware`.
- Both Program NCAs carry the base title ID. The scripts choose each one through its content meta: the Application
  meta names the base Program, the Patch meta names the update Program (a supported version; `--version <v>` requires
  one).
- For 2.0.0: the same XCI (or a base NSP) with `--update <the 2.0.0 NSP> --version v200`. The 2.0.0 NSP carries its
  common ticket. Its AES-CTR-Ex table ends at the indirect table instead of at itself, as 1.0.1's does; the indirect
  table is then plain AES-CTR with the section's own generation. `merge_romfs.Patched` accepts both layouts and records
  which (`aes_ctr_ex_covers` in `index.json`). 2.0.0's merged image is 14,331,812,280 bytes (`31afb6d9…`), 87.4 MB from
  the update. `romfs_control.py --update <nsp> --version v200` repeats the byte-flip control.
- The base is complete (not sparse, not compressed), unlike Bayonetta 3's. The code comes from the update, whose RomFS
  is a BKTR patch over the base: 79.8 MB of the merged image come from the update, 14.28 GB from the base.

## Stage 1 (done)

From `games/xcx`, with a Python environment made from `requirements.txt` in this folder plus `unicorn` for `equiv.py`
(`PY=<that python>`; `build_app.py` makes one in `XCX_build/venv`). The game file and keys are in `personal/` and the
work folder is `XCX_build/`, both at the repository root (ignored by git); the commands pass the work folder as `WORK`:

```sh
WORK=../../XCX_build
XCI="../../personal/Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition.xci"
KEYS=../../personal/prod.keys
$PY scripts/extract_code.py "$XCI" --keys $KEYS --output $WORK/extracted/v101/exefs
$PY scripts/merge_romfs.py "$XCI" --keys $KEYS --output $WORK/extracted/v101/romfs
$PY scripts/romfs_control.py "$XCI" --keys $KEYS          # negative control: two flipped bytes must be caught
for m in sdk subsdk0 main; do
  DM_RULESET=native DM_PRIVATE_GATES=0 $PY third_party/d2r/patch_nso.py $WORK/extracted/v101/exefs/$m $WORK/rewritten/v101 $m
done
$PY scripts/prepare_modules.py $WORK/extracted/v101/exefs --output $WORK/extracted/v101/elf
export LLVM_BIN="$(dirname "$(xcrun -f llvm-objdump)")" DM_VCACHE=$WORK/cache/verify_v101
for m in sdk subsdk0 main; do
  $PY third_party/d2r/structck.py $WORK/rewritten/v101 $m $WORK/extracted/v101/exefs/$m
  $PY third_party/d2r/equiv.py $WORK/rewritten/v101 $m $WORK/extracted/v101/exefs/$m --seed 1 --jobs 8
done
```

`assets/expected-v1.0.1.json` pins every resulting hash. `make` targets take the same folder: `make ... WORK=$WORK`.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| ExeFS (main, sdk, subsdk0, rtld, main.npdm) | FS header, hash table and every block verified; the program is the one the Patch meta 1.0.1 names; identical to the stage-0 extraction |
| Merged RomFS (complete base + BKTR update) | all six IVFC levels: 874,727 / 874,727 data blocks; 53 files, 14.3 GB; a flipped byte in update data and one in base data are both caught at the predicted block |
| Rewrite structure (`structck.py`) | OK for all three modules, 0 violations; a copy with one trampoline branch moved by +4 fails |
| Rewrite semantics (`equiv.py`, emulator, random states) | 36,697 sites, 0 divergent; all 900 mutation controls caught |

The rewrite needed one scan fix and no new block kind. `main` has 188 inline trap words `0xe7ffdefe`
(`cbz w0, +8; .inst 0xe7ffdefe`, an assert idiom). capstone stops a linear scan at the first word it cannot decode,
so two `br x18` jump tables (`main+0x1707e94`, `main+0x1707f20`) were never registered and the rewrite stopped with a
`KeyError`. `patch_nso.py` now scans past such words and leaves them as they are. The `sdk` and `subsdk0` output is
byte-identical to the stock rewriter's. `structck.py` writes its one-section ELF itself instead of calling
`llvm-objcopy`, which Xcode does not ship; `LLVM_BIN` only needs `llvm-objdump`.

## Stages 2 and 3: build and run (done)

After stage 1, from `games/xcx`, with the same `WORK` and `PY`:

```sh
# System fonts (the game's partitions have none): from the system update the XCI carries (or --firmware <NCA folder>)
$PY scripts/extract_shared_fonts.py --keys $KEYS --xci "$XCI" --output $WORK/extracted/firmware/shared-fonts
make prepare WORK=$WORK PY=$PY       # tables, RomFS index, fonts config; every input checked against assets/expected-v1.0.1.json
make runtime WORK=$WORK              # $WORK/build/xcx-native-v101
make shader-tools WORK=$WORK         # the shader translator and SPIRV-Cross the graphics layer starts on first use
cd $WORK
./build/xcx-native-v101 rewritten/v101 probe                                   # three modules, cross-module calls
TOTK_HEADLESS=1 TOTK_VERIFY_STARTUP=1 ./build/xcx-native-v101 rewritten/v101 boot   # to nnMain and on until a window is needed
TOTK_GPU_ALLOW_SUBMIT=1 ./build/xcx-native-v101 rewritten/v101 boot 2> logs/boot.log # with a window: the title screen
```

For 2.0.0: `make prepare runtime VERSION=v200 ...` and `./build/xcx-native-v200 rewritten/v200 ...`. Set
`TOTK_PROFILE_DIR=<a copy>` for a terminal run that must not touch the profile it would otherwise use (`user-data/`).

The run is from the work folder: `extracted/`, `rewritten/`, `build/` and the profile (`user-data/`: account, saves,
pseudo device id) are relative to it. `make boot` does the same and writes `logs/boot.log`. Keyboard (Bayonetta 3's map): J = A, K or Space
= B, I = X, U = Y, Return = +, Tab or Escape = -; the rest is in `runtime/input.c`.
Diagnostics: `TOTK_INPUT_FILE=<file>` takes lines appended while the game runs (`key <Mac keycode> <ms>`,
`shot <path>.png`, `close`); `XCX_AUDIO_LEVEL=1` logs the output's peak level every 5 s; `XCX_AUDIO=0` keeps a silent
sink. `scripts/symbolize.py` (with `XCX_WORK=<work folder>`) names the sdk functions of a host failure's call chain.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Probe | pass: main 926 / subsdk0 10,395 / sdk 23,007 symbols mapped, 4,000 calls main -> sdk -> host on 4 threads |
| Boot to `nnMain` | RomFS verified, every constructor state 2 (main 1,998, subsdk0 45, sdk 87 init_array entries), original `nnMain` entered |
| First frame | `first presented frame` at 0.33-0.64 s; title scene from about 4 s; about 2,000 draws a frame at 30 fps |
| Input, sound | the first menus follow the keyboard; AudioOut output peaks 5,500-17,500 of 32,767 at the title |

Screenshots: `docs/screenshots/xcx-stage3-first-frame.png`, `xcx-stage3-title.png`, `xcx-stage3-menu-after-input.png`
(repository root; screenshots show game imagery and stay local, ignored by git). Each gap the game reached, and how it
was answered, is in the changelog's stage-3 entry. At stage 3 text was not drawn and parts of the picture were wrong;
stage 4 fixed both (indexed quads, in the changelog).

## The app (stage 5)

Two kinds of app share one launcher (`app/launcher.m`) and one bundle description (`scripts/app_bundle.py`: name,
identifier, Info.plist and the files a self-contained app carries).

**Self-contained (`build_app.py` at the repository root).** The game folder is inside the app,
`Contents/Resources/xcx`, laid out like a work folder: `build/xcx-native` (the work folder's `build/xcx-native-<v>`), the shader tools
(`build/spirv-cross/spirv-cross`, `build/shader-service/totk_xlate`), `rewritten/<v>/*.patched.bin`,
`extracted/<v>/romfs/runtime-index.bin` and `extracted/firmware/shared-fonts`. The 14.3 GB `romfs.bin` is a data
bundle, `Contents/Helpers/GameData-<v>.bundle`, signed once in the work folder (`build/data-bundles`) and cloned in;
`extracted/<v>/romfs/romfs.bin` is a link to it. Everything is an APFS clone of the work folder's files, so the app
costs no extra space on the same volume, and it no longer needs the work folder. The launcher runs in this mode when
`Contents/Resources/xcx/build/xcx-native` is there (and `XCX_WORK` is not set). Everything the game writes goes to the
user's Library, so the signed bundle stays read-only:

- the shader cache to `~/Library/Application Support/MacNativeGames/XCX/shader-cache/rt-<chain>` (`XC_SHADER_CACHE`; `TOTK_SHADER_CACHE`,
  as Tears of the Kingdom's app uses, is still accepted),
- the RomFS check record to `.../XCX/app-romfs-record/` (the record names the image's file identity; the app's image
  is another file than the work folder's, so the two kinds of app keep separate records instead of replacing each
  other's and hashing 14 GB again in turn),
- the fonts are read from inside the app (`TOTK_SHARED_FONTS`), not from the work folder path compiled into the binary.

The app's profile is not seeded from a work folder (it has none). `--check` (run once by the build) only checks that the
game binary is in the app and that its version matches Info.plist, so macOS's first-run scan happens during the build.

**The window (`build_app.py --gui`).** `builder/` holds a small SwiftUI app (`BuilderApp.swift`, `BuildModel.swift`,
`ContentView.swift`, `TestHook.swift`, `Info.plist`) that `build_app.py --gui` compiles with `xcrun swiftc` (no Xcode
project) into `~/Library/Caches/MacNativeGames/xcx-builder/<hash>/XCX Builder.app`. The build is ad-hoc signed and
compiled again only when the sources or the compiler change. The app runs `build_app.py --progress json` (one JSON event
a line on stdout, the human log on stderr; SIGTERM cancels cleanly), and `--check-requirements --progress json` for
its prerequisites panel. `TestHook.swift` is for scripted checks only. With `XCX_BUILDER_TEST_*` set, it fills in the
fields, starts or cancels a build, writes its state to a file, and takes screenshots of its own window. It is inactive
otherwise.

**Development (`make app`).** After stages 1-3, from `games/xcx`, with the same `WORK` and `PY` (`GAME` and `KEYS`
absolute, for the icon):

```sh
make app WORK=$WORK PY=$PY GAME="$PWD/$XCI" KEYS="$PWD/$KEYS"   # -> $WORK/Xenoblade Chronicles X.app (about 3 MB)
make install WORK=$WORK                                         # optional: a copy in /Applications or ~/Applications
```

Launch it like any Mac app: double-click `XCX_build/Xenoblade Chronicles X.app` in Finder (or `open` it). A
settings window comes first (presets, frame rate, monitor, window or full screen, window size, output resolution,
scaler, interface mod, FPS overlay; no internal-resolution setting, as no patch for it exists); Play starts the game with
the switches the terminal runs set by hand
(`TOTK_GPU_ALLOW_SUBMIT=1` and the rest), the game's own 30 fps unless the frame rate is set to 60 (experimental, see
[60 fps](#60-fps-experimental)), the compact HUD, MetalFX upscaling and frame
interpolation off (key 2 still toggles interpolation; on an M1 it costs real frames). The development app does not hold
the game: it runs `build/xcx-native-<v>` from the work folder it names in its Info.plist, so the work folder must stay
where it was when the app was built.

- Progress: `~/Library/Application Support/MacNativeGames/XCX/profile` (account, saves, pseudo device id, pipeline
  list), for both kinds of app. On its first start the development app copies them from `$WORK/user-data`, so Continue
  goes on from the terminal runs' save; the originals are not changed. After that the two are separate.
- Shader cache: `$WORK/build/shader-cache/rt-*`, shared with `make boot`.
- Log: `~/Library/Logs/MacNativeGames/xcx.log` (both kinds; its `[launcher]` line says which kind ran and where the
  RomFS image is). Commands for the running game (`shot <path>.png`, `close`, ...) can be appended to
  `~/Library/Application Support/MacNativeGames/XCX/input.txt`; `open --env XCX_PLAY=1 <app>` skips the settings window,
  and `--env TOTK_SLOT_OWNER=<name>` marks a scripted run so that a game the user starts takes the game slot over.
- Player exefs patches (`make patches VERSION=<v>`: `mods/<1.0.1 | 2.0.0>/<name>/exefs/*.pchtxt`, for that version's
  main build ID, -> `$WORK/patches/<slug>.tsv`) have no
  setting in the window: `open --env XCX_PATCHES=<slug>,<slug> <app>` passes them to the runtime
  (`runtime/game_patches.c`), which checks every site before writing it. The port's own 60 fps patch is built in
  (`60fps`, the window's frame-rate setting adds it).

Checked 2026-10-23: the title offers Continue and it loads the save into Primordia, with no shader translated and no
pipeline built (`docs/screenshots/xcx-stage5-app-title.png`, `xcx-stage5-app-continue.png`; details in the changelog).
The self-contained app was checked the same way, also after being moved out of the work folder (changelog, "one-command
build").

## What the game uses

- NVN (SDK 19.3.2). Of the 535 NVN names main loads, 430 are implemented in this folder's layer and 7 are intentional
  no-ops; 97 are not, most of them getters. Unimplemented ones abort with their name when called.
- Wwise 2021.1.10 audio, Havok Physics 2023.2 (CPU only), Nintendo's online SDK (NPLN 1.32.1 with gRPC, OpenSSL,
  WebRTC and libcurl: needs offline answers for `nifm`, `friends`, `account`, `ssl`, `nsd`, the network clock, and the
  new `ngc` profanity filter and `caps:su` screenshots), `nn::os` fibers, movies as VP9 WebM (46 files), data in one
  10.2 GB `sts.ard` archive with its `sts.arh` header, sound in 5 Wwise `.pck` files.

## Next

Stage 4 and 5 are in progress; the changelog's Status table is kept current. Not checked yet: cities (New Los Angeles),
Skells, cutscenes, day-time lighting, water, menus beyond character creation, and a New Game with the current
build. Then: the rest of the online SDK's offline answers as the game reaches them, a resolution patch (the settings window has no such setting until it
exists), and a Metal cache warm-up for the app.

Up-front shader translation is done (2026-10-24): builds prepare every shader found in the player's game files and the
shared list (`docs/sharing-shaders.md` at the repository root is the player guide). Open: the list's pipelines
(phase 2: `R`, `B`, `S`, `C` rows are parsed but not produced or used yet), and a real test issue on GitHub, since the
workflow was only tested with the unit tests and has not run on a live issue.

### Maintainer setup for the shared list

Once, in the repository: Settings › Actions › General › Workflow permissions: Read and write permissions. If `main` is
protected, allow `github-actions[bot]` to push to it. Create the label `shader-list` (Issues › Labels; the issue form
applies it, and GitHub drops a label that does not exist) and `shader-list-undone` (an undo also creates it, but making
it up front is simpler). Nothing is needed per submission: `.github/workflows/shader-list.yml`
runs on every "Shader list:" issue, adds the rows through `scripts/process_shader_issue.py`, comments and closes. To undo
an issue: Actions › Shader list › Run workflow, with the issue number; it takes out the rows that issue added.

## 60 fps (experimental)

The game holds itself at 30 fps; the present interval is not what limits it. At start-up it sets a **vsync count** of 2,
and every frame ends in a busy wait until 2/60 s (times 0.997) have passed since the frame began; the frame time it
simulates with is also 2/60 s, fixed, whatever the frame really took. The patch (`runtime/game_patches.c`, slug
`60fps`, for 1.0.1 and 2.0.0) changes two places, each checked against the original instruction first:

- the vsync count 2 becomes 1, so the wait ends after 1/60 s and the game can run at up to 60 fps;
- the game's frame time (its GetFrameTime) returns the measured time of the last frames (the mean of the last 4
  intervals between presents, each held to 1/60..1/20 s) instead of a fixed 1/60 s, so the game keeps its speed when a
  frame takes longer than 1/60 s.

Where to switch it: the Mac app's settings window (**Frame rate: 30 (original) / 60 (experimental)**, saved; `open --env
XCX_FRAME_RATE=60 <app>` for one start), the iPhone / iPad Settings app (**Xenoblade Chronicles X › Frame rate**), or
`XCX_PATCHES=60fps` for a run from the terminal (`XCX_FPS60=0` keeps the patch in place but runs the original 30 fps).
30 is the default everywhere; with it the Mac runs unpatched code. The present base stays 60 Hz (`DM_PRESENT_HZ=60`).

What was checked (2.0.0, Primordia at night, MacBook Air M1; the changelog has the numbers): the frame rate rises from 30
to the GPU's limit (about 45-57 fps in the field on the M1, which needs about 18 ms of GPU a frame, less once the fanless
Air heats up; an iPhone 15 Pro Max about 50-58 fps in the field, down to 36-45 fps at times when it got hot); walking speed is the
same as at 30 fps (8.8 m/s); the clock's real-time counters advance at the same rate. Known limits: two of the game's
subsystems step by a fixed 1/60 s a frame (they read the vsync count), so they run slower than normal while the game is
below 60 fps; the time of day is frozen at that point of the story, so its speed could not be checked; cutscenes,
Skells and cities were not tested; on a fanless Mac or a phone the higher frame rate means more heat.

## iPhone and iPad (experimental)

`ios/` holds the iOS app, restored from the original project's `games/totk/ios` and adapted for this game.
`build_app.py --platform ios` runs `ios/tools/build_ipa.py` after the shared steps. It works like this:

1. The Mac runtime exports each module's patched text (`build/xcx-native-<v> rewritten/<v> export-ios`, `runtime/loader.c`).
2. `ios/tools/gen_embed.py` places the text, data and patch area of `main`, `sdk` and `subsdk0` in the executable's own
   segments (`__TOTKX` r-x, `__TOTK<module>W` rw), bound by SHA-256 in `ios_embed.h`. iOS cannot run code written at
   run time, so the loader remaps these segments instead (`TARGET_OS_IPHONE` in `loader.c`).
3. `ios/tools/build_deps.py` builds Opus and libvpx for the device with CMake.
4. `ios/tools/build_ipa.py collect_seed` gathers a shader seed from the Mac's caches. It only reads them.
5. xcodegen turns `ios/project.yml` into an Xcode project. The project has the Makefile's source list
   (`frontend_ios.m` in place of `frontend.m`, `loader.c` again with `-Dmain=totk_host_main`, and the graphics layer
   with `-DGAME_XCX`).
6. `xcodebuild -sdk iphoneos` builds the app, then the build packs the IPA.

Everything is generated under `<work>/build/ios*`.

The app (`ios/Sources/main.m`) sets the same runtime switches as `app/launcher.m`. The exported text carries the
60 fps patch's sites (code cannot change on the device), and the Settings app's Frame rate switch (30 by default) picks
the values the patch reads, so 30 runs the game's own pacing and frame time. The game image lives in
Documents/GameData. The runtime reads the index and the image from one folder (`TOTK_ROMFS`), so the app copies its index
there, and the Mac runtime is unchanged.

Open issues for a picture: up-front shader translation (every variant a draw can need, as the original project's seed,
for which `fill_shaders.py` is only a stopgap); the memory footprint on a phone (not measured); the audio output restart
after an interruption (`runtime_audio_output_restart` does not exist in this runtime; `main.m` has a stand-in that only
logs); on-device testing of input, saves and the RomFS check. `ios/tools/shader_contrib_watch.py` is a stub, because
there is no shared shader list.
