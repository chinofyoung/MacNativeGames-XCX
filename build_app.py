"""Turn your own copy of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (update 1.0.1 or 2.0.0) into a native Mac app, in one
command (or, experimentally, an unsigned iPhone / iPad IPA with --platform ios).

    python3 build_app.py <game.xci | base.nsp> -k <prod.keys> [--update <update.nsp>] [--firmware <folder>]
                         [-o <output .app | .ipa>] [--work <folder>] [--title-keys <title.keys>] [--platform macos|ios]
                         [--delete-work]

Supported: Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, base 0100453019AA8000 (v0) with its update 0100453019AA8800 in
version 1.0.1 (v65536) or 2.0.0 (v196608) (games/xcx/scripts/app_bundle.py VERSIONS), as
  - one XCI holding the base and the 1.0.1 update (as the game card does): builds 1.0.1, nothing else is needed;
  - the XCI (or a base NSP / base-only XCI) with --update <the 2.0.0 update NSP>: builds 2.0.0 (the update given wins
    over the one inside the XCI; 2.0.0 is cumulative over the base, so 1.0.1 is not needed);
  - a base NSP (or a base-only XCI) with --update <the 1.0.1 update NSP>: builds 1.0.1.
The version built is the update's. The game is recognised by the title IDs and versions inside the files
(games/xcx/scripts/identify_game.py), never by the file name; other titles and other versions are refused with a message
naming what the file is and the versions that are supported.

Updating: build again with the newer update to the same output (-o, or the default next to the game file). The app is
replaced; the saves are not in the app (~/Library/Application Support/XCNative/XCX/profile), so the new version
continues from them. A save that 2.0.0 has loaded and saved may not load in 1.0.1 again: the build says so when it
replaces an older app and prints the command that backs the profile up. Both versions can be built from one work folder
(extracted/<v>, rewritten/<v>, build/<v> stay apart), so going back to 1.0.1 is a rebuild that reuses its steps. NCAs of an NSP are
decrypted with the NSP's common ticket, or, when it has none (or a personalized one), with --title-keys <title.keys>.

Steps, each one checked against games/xcx/assets/expected-<version>.json (1.0.1 or 2.0.0), so a damaged dump or another version stops the
build at the first wrong file (a different dump of the same version is accepted: main.npdm by Nintendo's ACID signature
or, re-signed by a dump tool, once the code modules match; shared fonts by a verified, valid BFTTF structure):
  1. code: the update's ExeFS (games/xcx/scripts/extract_code.py: FS header, hash table and every block verified), the NSO
     segments checked and inventoried (prepare_modules.py), the three code modules rewritten for Apple silicon
     (games/xcx/third_party/d2r/patch_nso.py) and the rewrite checked twice: structure (structck.py) and semantics in
     an emulator with random states and mutation controls (equiv.py)
  2. fonts: the six system shared fonts, from the system update the XCI carries (its update partition) or from
     --firmware <unpacked firmware NCA folder> (needed for an NSP); every NCA level and each font verified
     (extract_shared_fonts.py)
  3. data: the base RomFS and the update's BKTR patch merged into one 14.3 GB image, all six IVFC levels verified
     (merge_romfs.py)
  4. prepare: the runtime's generated tables, RomFS index and fonts config (make prepare VERSION=<v>:
     scripts/prepare_runtime.py)
  5. runtime: the game binary of that version (make runtime VERSION=<v>)
  6. shader tools: the prebuilt shader translator, checked against its SHA-256, and SPIRV-Cross at its pinned commit,
     compiled with clang (make shader-tools); then every shader of the game translated ahead for its usual case and
     the cases the shared shader list names (games/xcx/scripts/prepare_shader_seed.py, docs/sharing-shaders.md; the
     list downloaded from GitHub and cached, or with --offline the cached or the project's one)
  7. app: the launcher and the icon from the game's own control data (make launcher icon), then a self-contained app:
     the code, fonts and RomFS index cloned into it, the RomFS image as a data bundle signed once in the work folder and
     cloned into Contents/Helpers (APFS clones: no extra space on the same volume), ad-hoc signed, registered, and run
     once in its check-only mode so that macOS's first-run scan happens now and not at the player's first start.
The Makefile in games/xcx stays the developer path (make prepare runtime app VERSION=<v>): this script runs the same
targets.

Every intermediate file is in the work folder (default: XCX_build at the repository root, next to this script, wherever
the game file is; the app goes next to the game file); a second run reuses what is already done and correct. The app
needs no work folder once built and may be moved, also to /Applications. --delete-work deletes the work folder after
a successful build (only a folder build_app.py made; never on a failure or a cancel), so a later build starts from
scratch (about 8 minutes). Saves, the shader cache, the RomFS check
record and the log go to the user's Library (~/Library/Application Support/XCNative/XCX,
~/Library/Logs/XCNative/xcx.log), so the signed app stays read-only. Folders from before 2026-10-24
(~/Library/Application Support/MacNativeGames/XCX, ~/Library/Logs/MacNativeGames) are moved there once, by the build
or the app's first start (app_bundle.migrate_library); the old caches are made again. Nothing from the game is in this repository;
everything is made from your files on your Mac. Key values are never printed.

Needs: macOS 26 or later on Apple silicon, the Xcode command line tools (Xcode for llvm-objdump), Homebrew with
    brew install opus libvpx python@3.14
and network access on the first run (the build's Python packages, SPIRV-Cross).
--platform ios (EXPERIMENTAL) makes an unsigned IPA for sideloading instead (default "<game file folder>/Xenoblade
Chronicles X.ipa"): steps 1-6 as above (the Mac runtime exports the patched code for the device), then
games/xcx/ios/tools/build_ipa.py: device Opus / libvpx (CMake, network once), the Xcode project (xcodegen), the build,
and the IPA. It needs Xcode 26 or later with the iOS SDK, xcodegen and CMake (brew install xcodegen cmake). The IPA
carries no game image: the 14.3 GB RomFS is installed once into the app's Documents (ios/tools/install_device.py
--game-data, or Finder's file sharing). A phone cannot translate shaders: the IPA carries the shaders prepared in step 6
and the ones this Mac has translated, and a draw needing a case nobody has shared yet is skipped.

    python3 build_app.py --gui

opens a window that does the same without the command line (games/xcx/builder: a small SwiftUI app, compiled with
xcrun swiftc on first use into ~/Library/Caches/XCNative/xcx-builder, and again when its sources change). The
window runs this script with --progress json: one JSON object a line on stdout (the plan, with the supported versions;
the start, with the version being built and the version of the app it replaces; the steps, each start and end with its
time; the error with the step it stopped at; the output), the human output on stderr; SIGTERM then cancels the
build cleanly (the work folder is resumable). --check-requirements [--platform ios] reports every requirement with
what to do about the missing ones (also with --progress json), for the window's prerequisites panel.
--identify <game> [--update <nsp>] -k <prod.keys> [--out <app>] reports what the files are (base, update version) and
the version of the app at the output, without building (one "identified" event a file with --progress json), for the
window's version labels.
